## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Auth
- User Registration and Login
- JWT-based session handling
- Passwords are hashed using `bcrypt`

---

### 📋 Task Management
- Create, edit, delete, and assign tasks
- Each task includes:
  - `title`
  - `description`
  - `status` (Todo, In Progress, Done)
  - `priority` (Low, Medium, High)
  - `assigned user`
- Drag and drop tasks between columns on the Kanban board

---

### 🌐 Real-Time Sync
- All changes (create/edit/delete/assign/drag-drop) are broadcast instantly to all users
- Built using **Socket.IO** on both frontend and backend

---

### 🧠 Smart Assign
- One-click **Smart Assign** button on each task
- Automatically assigns the task to the user with the **fewest active (non-Done) tasks**

---

### ⚔️ Conflict Handling
- If two users try to edit the same task:
  - Conflict is detected using the `updatedAt` timestamp
  - A **Conflict Resolution Modal** appears
  - Users can choose to:
    - ✅ **Overwrite** the task
    - 🔀 **Merge manually** using the modal interface

---

### 🕒 Activity Logs
- Logs every action:
  - Create
  - Edit
  - Delete
  - Assign
  - Drag & drop
- **Activity Log page** shows the most recent 20 actions
- Updated in **real-time** using Socket.IO

---

### 💫 UI & UX
- Fully **responsive**: works great on desktop and mobile
- Smooth transitions, drag animations, and modals
- Clean, minimal look
- **No UI libraries** used (fully custom CSS)

---

## 📜 Smart Assign Logic

- When a user clicks **Smart Assign**:
  - The backend counts how many active tasks (i.e., not "Done") each user currently has
  - The task is assigned to the user with the **fewest active tasks**
  - If there's a tie, the task is assigned to the user who registered **earlier**

---

## ⚔️ Conflict Handling Logic

- When a user tries to save changes to a task:
  - The client sends the current `updatedAt` timestamp in the request
  - The backend compares it with the latest timestamp in the database
- If the task was modified by someone else in the meantime:
  - Backend responds with a `409 Conflict` and sends back the latest version
  - Frontend shows a **Conflict Resolution Modal**
  - The user can then:
    - ✅ **Overwrite** → sends update with `force: true`
    - 🔀 **Merge** → manually resolve differences before re-submitting
